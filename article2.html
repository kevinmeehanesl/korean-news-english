            <h3>Article</h3>
            <p>
                On May 24, 2024, a significant security incident occurred at Seoul Station following a threat to stab 50 people. The Seoul Metropolitan Police Department received the threat and quickly mobilized a large-scale operation to secure the area and ensure public safety.
            </p>
            <p>
                The threat was reported early on Friday, prompting an immediate response from law enforcement. Authorities swiftly evacuated and cordoned off parts of Seoul Station, one of the busiest transport hubs in the city. Over 150 police officers, including special tactical units, were deployed to search for any potential threats or suspicious individuals.
            </p>
            <p>
                The police conducted a thorough search of the station, using bomb-sniffing dogs and advanced scanning equipment to ensure no dangerous materials were present. Despite the thorough search, no weapons or explosives were found, and no injuries were reported.
            </p>
            <p>
                Police Commissioner General Yoon Hee-keun emphasized the need for vigilance, especially in crowded areas, and assured the public that measures were being taken to prevent such threats in the future. The police are continuing their investigation to identify the source of the threat and to prevent any potential copycat incidents.
            </p>
            <p>
                The incident has raised concerns among the public about safety in public places. Citizens expressed their worries on social media, with many calling for increased security measures at major transportation hubs. This incident follows several high-profile stabbing attacks in South Korea, including a recent attack in Seongnam where a man wounded 14 people, intensifying the fear of random violence.
            </p>
            <p>
                South Korea is known for its low crime rate and high level of public safety. However, this incident highlights the need for continued vigilance and proactive measures to maintain security. The police have increased patrols in crowded areas and are implementing additional surveillance to deter potential threats.
            </p>
            <p>
                The authorities have urged the public to remain alert and report any suspicious activities immediately. They have also reiterated the importance of community cooperation in ensuring safety and preventing crime.
