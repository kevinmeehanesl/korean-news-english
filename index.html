            <h3>Article</h3>
            <p><strong>SEOUL</strong>, May 23 (Yonhap) -- <strong>Jamsil Station</strong> on <strong>Seoul's Subway Line No. 2</strong> is now the busiest station in the capital, surpassing <strong>Gangnam Station</strong>. Over 150,000 passengers use Jamsil Station every day, according to <strong>Seoul Metro</strong> on Thursday.</p>
            <p>In the first four months of this year, Jamsil Station in southeastern Seoul had an average of 155,229 passengers per day. <strong>In comparison</strong>, Gangnam Station had 151,607 passengers per day. This data was gathered from all stations on Lines 1-9 by Seoul Metro.</p>
            <p>Gangnam Station, located in southern Seoul, <strong>used to be</strong> the busiest station.</p>
            <p>Gangnam and Jamsil are very <strong>crowded</strong> because the subway is faster and more convenient than cars in these areas, due to heavy <strong>traffic congestion</strong>.</p>
            <p>Other busy stations with over 100,000 passengers per day include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hongik University Station</strong> on Line No. 2 (147,356)</li>
                <li><strong>Guro Digital Complex Station</strong> on Line No. 2 (106,564)</li>
                <li><strong>Seoul Station</strong> on Line No. 1 (105,265)</li>
                <li><strong>Sillim Station</strong> on Line No. 2 (103,582)</li>
                <li><strong>Samseong Station</strong> on Line No. 2 (101,475)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Seoul Metro also <strong>noted</strong> that the average number of subway users in Seoul per day was 8.8 million from January to April.</p>
            <p>Compared to other major cities <strong>worldwide</strong>, Seoul's subway system is extremely busy. <strong>For instance</strong>, the <strong>London Underground</strong>'s busiest station, <strong>Waterloo</strong>, handles about 100 million passengers annually, which translates to roughly 273,000 passengers per day. Similarly, <strong>Tokyo's Shinjuku Station</strong> is known as the world's busiest transport <strong>hub</strong>, with an average of 3.5 million passengers per day. While Seoul's numbers are slightly lower, they highlight the <strong>efficiency</strong> and popularity of the city's subway system.</p>
