Over 150,000 passengers use Jamsil Station every day, according to <strong>Seoul Metro</strong> on Thursday.</p>
        <p>In the first four months of this year, Jamsil Station in southeastern Seoul had an average of 155,229 passengers per day. <strong>In comparison</strong>, Gangnam Station had 151,607 passengers per day. This data was gathered from all stations on Lines 1-9 by Seoul Metro.</p>
        <p>Gangnam Station, located in southern Seoul, <strong>used to be</strong> the busiest station.</p>
        <p>Gangnam and Jamsil are very <strong>crowded</strong> because the subway is faster and more convenient than cars in these areas, due to heavy <strong>traffic congestion</strong>.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hongik University Station</strong> on Line No. 2 (147,356)</li>

Similarly, <strong>Tokyo's Shinjuku Station</strong> is known as the world's busiest transport <strong>hub</strong>, with an average of 3.5 million passengers per day.
