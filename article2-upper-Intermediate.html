                On May 24, 2024, Seoul Station faced a major security issue after a threat to stab 50 people was reported. The Seoul Metropolitan Police quickly responded, deploying over 150 officers, including special tactical units, to secure the area and ensure public safety.
            </p>
            <p>
                The threat was reported early in the morning, leading to a swift evacuation and cordoning off of parts of the busy station. Despite a thorough search using bomb-sniffing dogs and advanced scanning equipment, no weapons or explosives were found, and no injuries were reported.
            </p>
            <p>
                Police Commissioner General Yoon Hee-keun emphasized the importance of vigilance, especially in crowded areas. He assured the public that proactive measures were being taken to prevent such threats in the future. The police are investigating to find the source of the threat and prevent similar incidents.
            </p>
            <p>
                This incident has raised public concerns about safety in crowded places. Many people shared their worries on social media, calling for increased security measures at major transportation hubs. This follows several recent stabbing attacks in South Korea, including one in Seongnam where a man injured 14 people.
            </p>
            <p>
                South Korea is known for its low crime rate and high public safety. However, this event highlights the need for ongoing vigilance and proactive security measures. The police have increased patrols and implemented additional surveillance to deter potential threats. The public is urged to remain alert and report any suspicious activities.
